# Customer Analytics and Insights Platform POC

This proof of concept demonstrates a customer analytics platform with the following key features:

- Customer behavior analysis and segmentation using Python and scikit-learn
- Interactive data visualization dashboard
- Simulated real-time data processing
- Predictive analytics for customer churn risk
- Category-based insights and trend analysis

## Features

1. **Customer Segmentation**
   - K-means clustering based on purchase behavior
   - Visual representation of customer segments

2. **Predictive Analytics**
   - Churn risk prediction based on customer activity
   - Purchase pattern analysis

3. **Real-time Analytics**
   - Simulated real-time transaction monitoring
   - Live updates of customer behavior

4. **Interactive Dashboards**
   - Category performance visualization
   - Time series analysis of sales
   - Customer segment distribution
   - Real-time transaction feed

## Technical Stack

- Python 3.8+
- Flask (Web Framework)
- Pandas & NumPy (Data Processing)
- scikit-learn (Machine Learning)
- Plotly (Data Visualization)
- jQuery (Frontend Interactivity)

## Setup Instructions

1. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. Access the dashboard:
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`

## Features Demonstrated

   - Simulated customer data generation
   - Real-time data processing simulation
   - Scalable data handling architecture

2. **Analytics Capabilities**
   - Customer segmentation using machine learning
   - Predictive modeling for churn risk
   - Time series analysis of purchase patterns

3. **Visualization and Reporting**
   - Interactive charts and graphs
   - Real-time data updates
   - Multi-dimensional data analysis

4. **System Architecture**
   - Modular design for scalability
   - Real-time data processing simulation

## Notes

- This is a POC implementation focusing on demonstrating functionality
- Data is simulated for demonstration purposes
- The real-time processing is simulated using a background thread
- In a production environment, you would integrate with:
  - Real data sources
  - Apache Kafka for real-time processing
  - Cloud infrastructure (AWS) for scalability
  - Production-grade security measures
